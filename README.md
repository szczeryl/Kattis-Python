    Here is a collection of my Python files from the time I was a dumb kid in secondary school. 
    Hence, most of the solutions are not the best possible way to solve each question. 
    Nevertheless, I hope that some of you may find it useful. They used to be in another repository from my old account which I can no longer access since my school deleted my email when I graduated.
